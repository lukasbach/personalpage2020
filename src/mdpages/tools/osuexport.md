The script exports all songs from the music rythm game osu! (osugame.com) to a specified directory and renames and taggs them with their proper artist and title names.

It’s a very basic script, if you want to use it you have to specify the path to osu!’s songs and the target path as variables in the first few lines of the script. You can also change the naming convention.
