Hi! My name is Lukas. I'm currently studying computer science at the 
Karlsruhe Institut of Technology in germany. 

In this blog there will be posts about web and software developement
as well as other things that are interesting to me. 

Other things that I've done are documented under 
[current projects](/current/)
and under
[legacy projects](/legacy/).
Beware that the projects from the last page are very old things that 
I have done in my freetime, mostly before I have entered university 
and started using proper frameworks and following common coding 
guides, so they are buggy and are based on code which is not so nice
to look at (which does not mean that my current projects are perfectly
free of bugs and have the nicest code - I am improving, I promise!).

At the moment, I am working for LogMeIn in Karlsruhe as a working student in
software development and last year I have done my bachelor thesis at the Fraunhofer
IOSB.

I have also held a class called "Basic Notions of Computer Science" 
("Grundbegriffe der Informatik" in german) for computer science freshmen 
in my university, the associated slides as well as recaps for various
courses that I have written for myself are available under 
[educational](/edu/).
All those things are only available in german.
