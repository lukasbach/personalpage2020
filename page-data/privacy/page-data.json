For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only\nused where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.</p>\n<p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent in certain countries. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely\nwithdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>\n<p>This Website uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a\nthird-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the\nTrackers managed by them.\nThe validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the\nrelevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.\nIn addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information\nregarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information – such as the presence of other Trackers - in the linked privacy\npolicies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.</p>\n<p>To find more information dedicated to Californian consumers and their privacy rights, please read the section below regarding california\nresidents.</p>\n<h2>Third-party services that we may share data and cookies with</h2>\n<p>Some services use cookies from third parties, and share data with those parties.
