At the moment,\nthere are a few campaign levels and three Fill-The-Map levels which are essentially\nrandom-based levels. The balancing is also not so great at the moment.</p>\n<p>Other missing features (which may or may not be added later) include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Locking later campaign levels and unlocking them when the previous level is finished.</li>\n<li>Animated dialogs.</li>\n<li>Allow playing levels and campaigns designed by community (which should not be too hard,\nall levels are just JSON-data, just the logic to load external levels is missing).</li>\n<li>Level Editor</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Developing and Deploying</h2>\n<p>If you want to download and run the game locally, you can\ndo so by following the usual npm/yarn workflow, <code class=\"language-text\">yarn &amp;&amp; yarn start</code>\nto run the game and <code class=\"language-text\">yarn &amp;&amp; yarn run build</code> to build independent\ndeployment artifacts.</p>\n<p>The webapp was created using <code class=\"language-text\">create-react-app</code> and still uses\n<code class=\"language-text\">react-scripts</code> for building the app. </p>"}}}
